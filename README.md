# Single-Page-Applications
This is a repository of all my real time working single-page applications(SPA).
Covers everything learned from JS Applications and that was the assignment for the **exam** of the course.
Using **JS, HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap, Sammy(for routing), Handlebars(for templating) and Firebase(DB)**.
